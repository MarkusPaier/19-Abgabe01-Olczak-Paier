     *  - copy content of this git repository / zip file
     *
     *	- create your own remote repository, take care about Project Layout (!)
     *
     *  (! Student 1 !)
     *  - create Main Class with 'public static void main(String[] args)'
     *	- create empty getMinimum()
     *	- create empty getMaximum()
     *	- create addValue() which add an Integer to a list for later usage in getMinimum(), getMaximum() and other Methods
     *
     *  => publish current skeleton for your colleague(s) in remote repository
     *
     *
     *  (! Student 1 !)
     *  - implement getMinimum() which returns lowest Integer
     *	- test your method in main()
     *
     *  => publish current implementation for your colleague(s) in remote repository
     *
     *
     *  (! Student 2 !)
     *  - implement getMaximum() which returns highest Integer
     *	- test your method in main()

     *  => publish current implementation for your colleague(s) in remote repository
     *
     *
     * (! all Students !)
     *  - implement a sum() which returns the sum of all Integer Values added by add()
     *	- implement this method with different implementations
     *	- commit your changes
     *	- if every Student has finished with commit, start to push your implementation
     *	- if every implementation has been pushed to remote, tag final implementation with "FinalVersion"
     *
     *
     * FINAL ASSIGNMENT
     *  - don't forget to push everything (!)
     *	  AND final version includes
     *		- runnable source code
     *		- with test call methods in main Class
     *		- before commit take care that you previously tested your own source code
     * - finish your assignment at elearning website with publishing repository url
     *
     *

     *   				<- Checkout (From LOCAL)
